# Security Implementation for Monthly Organics

## Overview

Monthly Organics implements comprehensive data security measures to protect sensitive customer information from unauthorized access, including protection against potential security breaches.

## Security Features Implemented

### 1. Data Encryption

**Sensitive Data Protected:**
- Customer phone numbers (encrypted and hashed)
- Address details (house numbers, floor/door, contact numbers, landmarks)
- All personally identifiable information (PII)

**Encryption Method:**
- Uses Fernet (symmetric encryption) from the `cryptography` library
- AES 128 encryption in CBC mode with HMAC authentication
- Key derived using PBKDF2 with SHA-256 and 100,000 iterations
- Base64 encoding for secure storage

**Key Management:**
- Primary encryption key derived from environment variable `ENCRYPTION_KEY` 
- Fallback to session secret with cryptographic key derivation
- Fixed salt ensures consistent key generation across application restarts

### 2. Database Security

**Schema Changes:**
```sql
-- New encrypted columns added to users table
ALTER TABLE users ADD COLUMN phone_encrypted TEXT;
ALTER TABLE users ADD COLUMN phone_hash VARCHAR(64);

-- New encrypted columns added to addresses table
ALTER TABLE addresses ADD COLUMN house_number_encrypted TEXT;
ALTER TABLE addresses ADD COLUMN floor_door_encrypted TEXT;
ALTER TABLE addresses ADD COLUMN contact_number_encrypted TEXT;
ALTER TABLE addresses ADD COLUMN nearby_landmark_encrypted TEXT;
```

**Search Capabilities:**
- Phone numbers use SHA-256 hash for secure lookups
- Original phone numbers never stored in plaintext
- Hash-based searching prevents brute force attacks

### 3. Security Services

**SecureUserService:**
- Handles user creation and authentication with encryption
- Phone number encryption during registration
- Secure lookup using hash-based search

**SecureAddressService:**
- Encrypts sensitive address fields before storage
- Decrypts data only when needed for display
- Maintains locality/city/pincode in plaintext for delivery logistics

**SecurityAuditLogger:**
- Comprehensive logging of all data access events
- Authentication event tracking
- Encryption/decryption operation logs

### 4. Data Migration

**Existing Data Protection:**
- Automatic migration of existing plaintext data to encrypted format
- Backward compatibility during transition period
- Verification system to ensure successful migration

**Migration Features:**
- One-time migration script for existing customer data
- Manual migration endpoint: `POST /admin/migrate-data`
- Migration verification and rollback capabilities

### 5. Security Best Practices

**Input Validation:**
- Centralized form validation with sanitization
- Protection against SQL injection using parameterized queries
- XSS prevention through proper data escaping

**Session Security:**
- Secure session management with encrypted session keys
- Session timeout and proper cleanup
- CSRF protection through form validation

**Audit Trail:**
- Complete audit logging for all sensitive data operations
- Security event monitoring and alerting
- Failed operation tracking for security analysis

## Security Configuration

### Environment Variables Required

```bash
# Primary encryption key (recommended)
ENCRYPTION_KEY=your-32-byte-base64-encoded-key

# Session secret (required for Flask)
SESSION_SECRET=your-session-secret-key

# Database connection (already configured)
DATABASE_URL=postgresql://...
```

### Generating Encryption Key

```python
from cryptography.fernet import Fernet
key = Fernet.generate_key()
print(key.decode())  # Use this as ENCRYPTION_KEY
```

## Data Protection Levels

### Level 1: Encrypted Fields
- Phone numbers
- House numbers
- Floor/door details
- Contact numbers
- Personal landmarks

### Level 2: Hashed Fields
- Phone number hashes for search
- Authentication tokens

### Level 3: Plaintext (Business Requirements)
- Locality names (needed for delivery routing)
- City names (needed for delivery zones)
- Pincode (needed for delivery logistics)
- Product information (public data)

## Compliance and Standards

**Security Standards Met:**
- Data encryption at rest
- Secure key management
- Audit logging
- Input validation and sanitization
- Session security

**Privacy Protection:**
- Minimal data collection
- Purpose limitation (data used only for delivery)
- Data minimization (only necessary fields encrypted)
- User consent through registration process

## Monitoring and Alerts

**Security Monitoring:**
- Failed authentication attempts
- Encryption/decryption failures
- Unusual data access patterns
- Database connection anomalies

**Log Analysis:**
```bash
# Security audit logs
grep "SECURITY_AUDIT" application.log

# Encryption events
grep "ENCRYPTION_AUDIT" application.log

# Authentication events
grep "AUTH_AUDIT" application.log
```

## Incident Response

**In Case of Security Breach:**
1. Immediately rotate encryption keys
2. Analyze security audit logs
3. Notify affected customers
4. Review and strengthen security measures
5. Update encryption algorithms if necessary

**Key Rotation Process:**
1. Generate new encryption key
2. Update ENCRYPTION_KEY environment variable
3. Run data re-encryption script
4. Verify all data integrity
5. Update backup encryption

## Testing Security

**Manual Security Tests:**
1. Verify encrypted data in database
2. Test decryption functionality
3. Validate audit logging
4. Check input sanitization
5. Test authentication security

**Migration Status:** âœ… COMPLETED - Email removal and phone encryption fully implemented.

This security implementation protects customer data while maintaining full functionality.
