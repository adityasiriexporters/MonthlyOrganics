# Monthly Organics

## Overview

Monthly Organics is a Flask web application for an organic produce delivery service. The application provides a platform for customers to subscribe to monthly organic produce deliveries. The system is built with Flask as the backend framework, uses PostgreSQL for data storage, and features a modern frontend with Tailwind CSS, Alpine.js, and htmx for enhanced interactivity.

## System Architecture

The application follows a traditional Flask web application architecture with the following layers:

1. **Presentation Layer**: HTML templates with Tailwind CSS styling and Alpine.js for client-side interactivity
2. **Application Layer**: Flask routes and business logic
3. **Data Layer**: PostgreSQL database with SQLAlchemy ORM
4. **Static Assets**: CSS, JavaScript, and image files served directly

The architecture separates concerns between the main application entry point (`main.py`) and the route handlers (`app/main.py`), allowing for better organization and scalability.

## Key Components

### Backend Components

- **Flask Application**: Main web framework handling HTTP requests and responses
- **SQLAlchemy ORM**: Database abstraction layer with declarative models
- **PostgreSQL Database**: Primary data storage using psycopg2-binary for connection
- **Models**: User, Address, and Subscription entities with proper relationships

### Frontend Components

- **Tailwind CSS**: Utility-first CSS framework for responsive design
- **Alpine.js**: Lightweight JavaScript framework for reactive components
- **htmx**: Library for AJAX interactions without writing JavaScript
- **Custom Animations**: Fade-in effects and smooth transitions

### Database Schema

The application defines the following core models:

1. **User Model**: Stores customer information including email, name, phone, and status
2. **Address Model**: Manages delivery addresses with support for multiple addresses per user
3. **Subscription Model**: (Referenced but not fully implemented in current codebase)

## Data Flow

1. **Request Handling**: Flask receives HTTP requests and routes them to appropriate handlers
2. **Database Operations**: SQLAlchemy manages database connections and queries
3. **Template Rendering**: Jinja2 templates render HTML responses with dynamic content
4. **Static Asset Serving**: CSS, JavaScript, and images served directly by Flask
5. **Client-side Interactivity**: Alpine.js and htmx handle dynamic frontend behavior

## External Dependencies

### Python Dependencies
- **Flask**: Web framework
- **Flask-SQLAlchemy**: Database ORM integration
- **psycopg2-binary**: PostgreSQL database connector
- **Werkzeug**: WSGI utilities and middleware

### Frontend Dependencies (CDN)
- **Tailwind CSS**: Styling framework
- **Alpine.js**: JavaScript framework
- **htmx**: AJAX library

### Database
- **PostgreSQL**: Primary database system

## Deployment Strategy

The application is configured for deployment with the following considerations:

1. **Environment Variables**: 
   - `DATABASE_URL`: PostgreSQL connection string
   - `SESSION_SECRET`: Flask session encryption key

2. **Production Readiness**:
   - ProxyFix middleware for proper HTTPS handling
   - Database connection pooling with health checks
   - Logging configuration for debugging and monitoring

3. **Health Monitoring**:
   - Health check endpoint for monitoring service status
   - Database connection testing
