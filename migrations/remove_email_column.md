# Email Column Removal Migration - COMPLETED

## Status: âœ… COMPLETED (August 7, 2025)

This migration successfully removed the email column from the users table and updated all related code to eliminate email dependencies.

## Summary
- Email column removed from users table
- All SQL queries updated to exclude email references  
- Admin panel updated to work with phone-based identification only
- User creation/lookup functions properly with encrypted phone numbers
- Database export functionality works correctly with decryption options

## Result
Users are now identified exclusively by:
- Encrypted phone numbers (`phone_encrypted` + `phone_hash`)
- Custom IDs for admin reference
- Names for search functionality

The system maintains full functionality while operating on phone-based user identification with proper encryption.
