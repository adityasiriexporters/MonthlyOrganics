Hello! I am building a new Flask web application called 'Monthly Organics'. Please set up the entire project foundation for me by following these steps precisely:

Step 1: Create the Project Structure
Create the following directory structure in the project root:

app/

static/

static/css/

static/js/

static/img/

templates/

Next, take the uploaded logo file fulllogo_transparent.png and move it into the static/img/ directory.

Step 2: Initialize the Python Flask Backend
In the app/ directory, create a file named main.py. Inside main.py, write the Python code to:

Import Flask.

Create a basic Flask application instance.

Define a function named get_db_connection(). IMPORTANT SECURITY REQUIREMENT: This function must connect to a PostgreSQL database using the psycopg2-binary library. It must read the full database connection URL from a Replit Secret named DATABASE_URL.

Create a main index route @app.route('/') that renders an HTML template called index.html.

Step 3: Create the Base HTML Template
In the templates/ directory, create a file named base.html. This file should be a standard HTML5 boilerplate. In the <head> section, you must include the following:

A link to a local stylesheet at /static/css/style.css.

The latest CDN script for Tailwind CSS.

The latest CDN script for Alpine.js (with defer).

The latest CDN script for htmx.

Step 4: Configure Frontend Tools

In the project root, create a tailwind.config.js file. Inside this file, configure the theme.extend.colors object to include our official brand palette:

primary: '#2C7A3C'

secondary: '#402D1C'

background: '#F9F1E5'

In the static/css/ directory, create a file named style.css. Add the three standard Tailwind @tailwind directives to this file.

Step 5: Create a Test Home Page
Finally, in the templates/ directory, create the index.html file. This file should:

Extend the base.html template.

Inside the <body>, have a <div> with a light background using our custom brand color: bg-background.

Inside that <div>, add an <h1> heading with the text "Welcome to Monthly Organics" and color it with our custom primary color: text-primary.

Display the brand logo from static/img/fulllogo_transparent.png below the heading.

After you run this, I expect to have a fully structured project, a running Flask server, and a simple homepage that proves Tailwind CSS is correctly configured with our custom brand colors.
