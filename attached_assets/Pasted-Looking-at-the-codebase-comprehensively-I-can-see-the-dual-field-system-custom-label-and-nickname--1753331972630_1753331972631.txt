Looking at the codebase comprehensively, I can see the dual field system (custom_label and nickname) is causing unnecessary complexity. Here's my analysis:

Issues to be Fixed
1. Dual Field Complexity
Every address form has both custom_label (visible) and nickname (hidden) fields
JavaScript synchronization required between these fields
Forms break if synchronization fails
Confusing code maintenance
2. Inconsistent Field Usage
Backend functions read from nickname field
Users interact with custom_label field
Database stores nickname but forms show custom_label
Template confusion about which field to use
3. JavaScript Synchronization Dependencies
All 4 address pages need identical synchronization code
Easy to miss when adding new address forms
Creates fragile dependencies
4. Backend Processing Inconsistencies
Some functions expect custom_label, others expect nickname
Form validation uses different field names
Database queries search for nickname but forms might send custom_label
Root Causes
1. Historical Legacy
The dual field system was created to handle form display vs. database storage, but it created more problems than it solved.

2. Form Framework Mismatch
The HTML forms were designed with separate display/storage fields, but the backend wasn't consistently updated to handle this pattern.

3. Incremental Feature Addition
The custom_label field was added later without fully replacing the nickname field, creating a hybrid system.

Precautions Before Proceeding
1. Data Integrity
Critical: Ensure existing address data isn't lost during migration
Backup the addresses table before making changes
Test incremental label generation works with single field
2. Backend Compatibility
All functions that reference nickname must be updated
Form validation in validators/forms.py needs updating
Database queries need field name changes
3. Frontend Dependencies
All 4 address templates need consistent updates
JavaScript validation code needs updating
Ensure no broken form submissions
4. Incremental Label Logic
The generate_incremental_label() function must work with unified field
Test edge cases: duplicate labels, special characters, empty values
Ensure incremental numbering doesn't break
Recommended Solution
Unify on nickname field since:

It's already the database column
Backend functions already use it
Incremental label generation works with it
Less code changes required
Implementation Steps Needed
Remove custom_label fields from all 4 address templates
Make nickname field visible with proper styling
Remove JavaScript synchronization code
Update form validation to use nickname
Update backend functions to consistently use nickname
Test incremental label generation thoroughly
This will eliminate the dual field complexity while maintaining all existing functionality including incremental label generation and backend compatibility.
