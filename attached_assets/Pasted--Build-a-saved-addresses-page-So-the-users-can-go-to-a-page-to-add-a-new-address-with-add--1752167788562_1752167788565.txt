And build 'Add new address' page. for the user to add new address (by giving the pin location and filling the form)]


- upon clicking 'add new address' button on the saved addresses page. User should be taken to collect the pin location and to fill the form. In order. 

  • Collecting map pin location from the user.
    * A div with id="map" to hold the interactive Google Map for pinning the location. 
    * This map should be opened on the full screen (the header and footer must be in place). So that, while sliding/scrolling on any part of the screen, the user can slide or scroll inside the map only (not on the page or form).   
    * There should be two buttons ('Detect Current Location' & 'Confirm Location') respectively to detect the current location of user and confirm the pin location of the address. These two buttons should be padded above the Footer/navigation bar.
    * User, upon confirming the pin location of the address. The map should be restored/resized with the location pin/dot in the 3:2 window (fitting on the mobile screen)(Landscape). before the form. 
    * There should be an option to change or iterate the pin location. Even after the map is restored or resized to small size.
    * User has to mandatorily confirm a pin location. To proceed to add a new address. (mandatory field)

 • The complete address form within the template must contain input fields for all of the following details. Please mark the mandatory fields clearly for the user to know.

'Address' section
    * Hno/Plot No/Building/Community Name (mandatory field)
    * Block Name/No
    * Floor/Door Number (mandatory field)
    * Locality (to be taken automatically from the map and still can be editable. without disturbing the user given pin location)
    * City (to be taken automatically from the map and is non editable)
    * Pincode (to be taken automatically from the map and is non editable)
    * Nearby Landmark

'Address label' section : User should give the address label mandatorily (mandatory field) . (eg: Home, Office, Friend's home etc...) (This label is used as a representation of the given address, at the time of checkout)

'Receiver's information' section 
    * Receiver's name (mandatory field)
    * Receiver's Number (mandatory field)

"Save address" button
    * The user can add/save a new address with the "Save address" button, Only when all the mandatory fields are filled (with atleast a character). If the mandatory fields are not filled, then the user should be taken back to the mandatory field to fill (with auto-scroll).

- This newly added/saved address should be displayed in the 'saved addresses' page.
- Like this user can add multiple addresses from the 'Add new address' button in the 'saved addresses' page.
- Users should be able to manage these saved addresses in 'saved addresses' page by:
    * Setting it as default
    * Editing the saved addresses
    * Deleting the saved addresses
- Upon clicking on 'editing' option corresponding to a saved address. User should be taken to 'edit address' page, which should be same as 'Add new address' page.
- I am ready to give Google Maps API now.

- I want any data given by the customers (like phone number, name, address details etc. and any other) to be very safe and secured.
- I don't know if you want to encrypt this data. To protect this data from the hackers
